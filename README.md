# JTP

(Justin's Trash Pile)

This is a collection of C files I use in a bunch of hobby projects. It's _kind of_ a game engine, with no real attempt to serve anyone but me, but I wanted to check this in so I can keep it in sync between laptops. At the moment this is intended for me alone, I just didn't want to shove it into a private repo because I already have enough code rotting in those, gotta air this stuff out.

This doesn't really work at the moment, as I'm copying junk over from other quarter-finished game repos, random tutorials, copy-pasting raw code from Stackoverflow, suggestions from my cat, etc., but at some point I'll throw up build instructions when I think its partially usable.

This is very NIH-y, mostly meant for me to build the tools I need, for fun and learning purposes. Its highly inspired by higher quality software like: 

* [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
* [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
* [cute_headers](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers)
* [nez framework](https://github.com/prime31/Nez)
* [handmade hero](https://handmadehero.org/)
* [libgdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/)

This is also heavily based on the excellent:
* [learn opengl](https://learnopengl.com/)
